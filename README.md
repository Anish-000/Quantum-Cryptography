# Quantum-Cryptography
This is my basic research about Quantum Cryptography

This repository documents my initial research into Quantum Computing and Quantum Cryptography, focusing on learning the fundamentals and understanding specific cryptographic algorithms like Saber and Kyber (both PKE and KEM).


🔍 Overview

Quantum Cryptography is a field that leverages principles of quantum mechanics to secure data transmission. With the advent of quantum computers, traditional cryptographic schemes face potential vulnerabilities. As a student currently pursuing MCA, I am researching the basics of quantum computing and its implications on cryptography.

📌 Why This Research?

With the rapid development of quantum computing, cryptographic algorithms currently in use (RSA, ECC, etc.) are at risk of being broken. This research aims to understand the fundamentals of quantum-resistant algorithms like Saber and Kyber, which are part of the NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography standardization process.
